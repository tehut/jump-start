# Assignment: Breaking Down Identity

Our identities are complicated. We carry with us many different affinities, including race, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and class, just to name a few. Some parts of ourselves may garner privilege, while others may be culturally marginalized.  We can use the term “intersectionality” to refer to this understanding of multiplicity.

Please answer the following reflection questions on a separate paper.

1. List as many of your own identity categories as you can: (e.g. race, class, gender, age, religion, education, family structure, etc)
Cis-Woman, Ethiopian-American, Black, Able-Bodied, Straight-Passing, Queer, Kinky, Immigrant, Well-Educated, Upper-Middle Class



2. Which part of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?   I'd say I'm most aware of being an Ethiopian0-American and Black Woman.  Which are indentities I see as nested within one another

3. Which part of your identity are you least aware of on a daily basis?  I'm least often aware of being able-bodied and cis.

4. Which part of your identity was the most emphasized growing up?  My Ethiopian-American and Black identities were strongly reinforced in my family and community. 

5. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most misunderstood? As an upper-middle class African immigrant,the similarities between my culture and mainstream American culture makes my blackness effortlessly digestible.  It makes me uncomfortable to know that people are often tempted to relate to me as proof of their racial virtue and in a way that absolves them of engaging in the more challenging work of dealing with anti-blackness & anti-poverty.

6. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most difficult to discuss with those who identify differently? I'm generally comfortable discussing my kink with friends who know me well and don't share my identity but it is the part of myself that I was most ashamed of as a child and discuss least. 

7. Which part of your identity grants you the most privilege? I'd say it's the combination of class and the education afforded by it.  

8. Which part of your identity feels the most marginalized?  My blackness.
